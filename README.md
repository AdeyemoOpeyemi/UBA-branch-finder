# üè¶ UBA Branch Finder (Python)

This project provides a **Python implementation** to search and fuzzy-match the locations of **UBA bank branches in Nigeria**.  

The script uses a **CSV dataset** of UBA branches, integrates fuzzy matching (`rapidfuzz`) for flexible searches, and performs geocoding using **OpenStreetMap‚Äôs Nominatim API** (Nigeria only). It also includes a Streamlit application for interactive usage.
